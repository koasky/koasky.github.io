<h2>The Ghosts Of 1894</h2>

<p class="reiew">Oduor Jagero‚Äôs sophomore novel is a fast-paced, suspense-filled, heart-breaking, soul-searching, hope-finding tale! (Yes, you can now pause for breath before I continue.) I think East Africa‚Äôs writing star just gets brighter and brighter. We have here, a complement to the works of East African writing maestros like Jennifer Makumbi, Binyavanga Wainana, Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor, who all continue to give a new narrative of Africa; an Africa that understands herself, her past and works to build her future.

<h2>True Citizen</h2>

<p class="reiew">The book starts with a quote <blockquote>‚ÄúWhen suffering knocks at your door and you say there is no seat for him, he tells you not to worry because he has brought his own stool.‚Äù ‚Äì Chinua Achebe.</blockquote>

The story is about Mayna, a Matatu driver in Nairobi, Kenya who is starting a kind of revolution in his country. I don‚Äôt want to tell a lot about the story because it‚Äôs better if you read it by yourself.

What I found most interesting are the descriptions of normal life in Nairobi. The life of all the characters like Mayna, his parents, his wife Nyawira and his daughter Maria who suffers from a serious illness. The corrupt police officer Captain Ademba and his wife Achieng. The owner of the Matatu and his conductor Kama. A group of hackers who helped Mayna providing a website (Joomla üôÇ ), a twitter account, a facebook page and a lot of data they took from the government and media agencies.</p>
